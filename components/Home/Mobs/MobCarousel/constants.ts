      "The Behemoth is a machine in Horizon Zero Dawn. It is a large Transport Class machine, inarguably the largest and most powerful known machine of this class. Its primary purpose is the collection of resources from smaller Acquisition Class machines and the transport of these resources to cauldrons for machine manufacture. It collects these resources using its anti-gravity technology. With the onset of the Derangement, this technology is used by the machine for lethal attacks on any human it encounters.",

It is not a contemporary machine; rather it is one of three machines of the ancient Chariot Class, manufactured by the robotics and technology corporation Faro Automated Solutions during the mid 21st century. As such, it was designated by FAS as the FAS-FSP5 Khopesh. However one swarm of Chariot robots, including Khopeshes, went out of control, becoming the Faro Plague, and ultimately eradicated all life on Earth.",
